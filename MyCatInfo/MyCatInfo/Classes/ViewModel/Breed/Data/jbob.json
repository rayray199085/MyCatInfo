They love to be with people and play seemingly endlessly. They learn their name and respond to it. They bring toys to people and play fetch with a favorite toy for hours. Bobtails are social and are at their best when in the company of people. They take over the house and are not intimidated. If a dog is in the house, Bobtails assume Bobtails are in charge.","life_span":"14 - 16","indoor":0,"lap":1,"alt_names":"Japanese Truncated Cat","adaptability":5,"affection_level":5,"child_friendly":4,"dog_friendly":5,"energy_level":5,"grooming":1,"health_issues":1,"intelligence":5,"shedding_level":3,"social_needs":5,"stranger_friendly":5,"vocalisation":5,"experimental":0,"hairless":0,"natural":1,"rare":0,"rex":0,"suppressed_tail":1,"short_legs":0,"wikipedia_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Bobtail","hypoallergenic":0}],"id":"Sw_EWWLW-","url":"https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/Sw_EWWLW-.jpg","width":3949,"height":3949}]
